## About the Project

C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a zero-player game based on the evolution of a set of cells arranged in a grid. This grid has an initial random arrangement of living and dead cells and changes according to two rules:

- Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### Written In

* [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)

### Built With

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* g++
  ```sh
  apt install g++
  ```
* make
  ```sh
  apt install make
  ```

### Download and Installation

Latest release can be found at [here](https://github.com/LuismGH/GameOfLife/releases) as source code.

1. Download latest release
2. Compile
   ```sh
   make
   ```
3. Execute
   ```sh
   make run
   ```

## Usage

Dimensions for the board will be requested by keyboard. With that input, a random cell arrangement will be generated. It is necessary to enter a number of turns to observe and study the board's evolution.

## Bugs

Please report all bugs [here](https://github.com/LuismGH/GameOfLife/issues). If appropriate, please attach a small test volume which you think GameOfLife isn't handling correctly.
